## GSOC - Add Support for Custom Resource Definitions to the Dashboard

Progress tracker for my GSoC project for CNCF &amp; Kubernetes - Add Support for Custom Resource Definitions to the Dashboard

To easier track the progress, I've created a public Trello board and a Google Document. I'll provide daily progress updates in both Google Document and Trello Board.

## Abstract

> The Kubernetes dashboard previously supported Third Party Resources (TPR), but these were replaced in Kubernetes by Custom Resource Definitions (CRD). As a result, the original TPR support was removed in Dashboard, but CRD support has not been added yet. This proposal aims at providing a generic support for Custom Resource Definitions to the dashboard, similar to the previous TPR support.
